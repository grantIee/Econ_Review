# Consumer Theory 1

### Preferences

*Let X denote a set of options (or states of the world).*


**Weak Preference Relation**


Let x and y denote two distinct options:

- {$$}x \succeq_i y{/$$} means that, for agent *i*, *x* is weakly preferred to *y*. 

**Indifference and Strict Preferences**

- {$$}x \sim y \Longleftrightarrow (x \succeq y \wedge y \succeq x){/$$}

- {$$}x \succ y \Longleftrightarrow (x \succeq y \wedge y \nsucceq x){/$$}


### Rationality

Two assumptions must be met:


1. The relationship must be **complete**


This just means that all choices in the preference scheme must be compared at one point.


**For example:**


We have the following relationships:


{$$} z \sim y, x \preceq y, z \succeq y, x \sim y{/$$}


We get the following unique comparisons: {$$} z \rightarrow y, x \rightarrow y{/$$}


Hence we are missing the relationship between *x* and *z*. Which means that this relationship is not rational because it is not complete...



2. The relationship must be **transitive**


This means that all relationships must agree with each other. The whole a = b and b = c, therfore, a = c deal. 


As long as these criteria are met, then the original relationship must be *rational*.



3. The relationship must be **continuous** (OPTIONAL)


This means that there must be some mixture of the good and bad options that's equally good to the middle option. 


*This may be problematic because there are times when there is no probability that would allow for individuals to be indifferent to the middle option. In the case that death is the worst case scenario, then most individuals would have a hard time deciding a probability in any situation.*


4. The relationship must be **Independent**


This means that if you prefer, say, M to L, then you should also prefer a lottery over M and any other thing to a lottery over L and that same other thing.


*This may be problematic because it is based on a weak assumption and can be violated at times.*


### The Utility Function

*Note most utility functions deal with the **ordinality** of the two objects being compared and not the **cardinality**.*


Remember that arg max is the value that would go into the utility function that returns the max utility.


### Opporutnity Cost

> *The utility value of the best alternative that we forgo, or give up, when we make a choice or a decision.*


NOTE: Remember that the opportunity is often the entire cost. Hence, you add up all the losses. You compare the losses and the current value to calculate the amount that would be needed to change your current choice. 


### Marginal Utility

**Forward Marginal Utility:**


The additional satisfaction gained from one more unit of a good: {$$}MU^F(x) = u(x+1) - u(x){/$$}


|x|u(x)|{$$}MU^F(x){/$$}|{$$}MU^B(x){/$$}}|
|0|0|4||
|1|4|3|4|
|2|7|2|3|
|3|9|1|2|
|4|10||1|

Hence, when doing forward, the last value must be blank because you are taking the difference between the one after the current one and the current one.
