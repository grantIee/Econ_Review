# Consumer Theory 2

### Canonical Utility Functions


We don't consume a single good; hence, we need to be able to model more than one good.


- Fixing y, if x' > x, we want {$$}u(x',y) \geq u(x,y){/$$}

    - Utility is weakly increasing in each good.

    - Can be justified by free disposal assumption

    - Free disposal states that having more of a particular good shouldn't cost anything, hence, it shouldn't be a burden for me to get one more of something. Won't make me better off or worse off.


{$$}
\dots
{/$$}


**Perfect Substitutes (u(x,y) = x + y)**


- The two objects are essentially the same. Hence, the only thing that will most likely matter is the amount that can be purchased.
- The relationship is not limited to 1:1, can be 1:2, 2:5, etc.


**Perfect Complements (u(x,y) = min(x,y))**

- The both objects are useless without the other. Hence, you want to have the exact same amount of the two 
- The relationship is not limited to 1:1, can be 1:2, 2:5, etc.


**Cobb-Douglas (u(x,y) = {$$}x^a \cdot y^b{/$$}**

- These are your normal goods where the values of the utility will actually matter. Hence, you want to check for how much benefit you get from consuming one good.
- This one is related to the **Logarithmic (u(x,y) = ln(x \cdot y))**

### Indifference Curves

Represents all possible bundles to create one utility value.


Hence, each line in an indifference curve will represent a utility value, and the x and y coordinates of a given point along the line is the bundle that corresponds to that utility value.


### Ordinal Equivalence

Two functions may be *ordinally equivalent* when the outcome of the function **always** leads to the same choices.


### Marginal Rate of Substitution

> *The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the rate at which an agent is willing to substitute good x for good y while maintaining the same level of utility*


Equation: {$$} MRS_{xy}(x,y) = \frac{MU_X(x,y)}{MU_y(x,y)} {/$$}


ALSO: {$$} MRS_{xy}(x,y) = -\text{Slope of indifference curve through (x,y)} {/$$}

### Budget Constraints

Now when we are given the choice between two potential items, how do we know how much of each to get?


w = wage, because not everyone is infinitely rich


{$$} 
p_x \cdot x + p_y \cdot y \leq w
{/$$}


Using this, you may construct something called a budget set, which is all the possible bundles that can be purchased.
