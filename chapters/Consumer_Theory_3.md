### Choice (CD & Log)

How do agents choose consumption bundles?


The optimal bundle:
* It is on the budget line.
* The slope of the indifference curve running through it matches the slope of the budget line.


**GOLDEN RULE FOR OPTIMAL CONSUMPTION**

1. On the budget line suggests:
{$$}
p_x \cdot x^* + p_y \cdot y^* = w
{/$$}


2. The slope of the indifference curve must equal the slope of the budget line:

    a. **Cobb Douglas**: 


    {$$} MRS_{xy}(x^*,y^*) = \frac{p_x}{p_y} {/$$}


    b. **Perfect Complements**:


    if {$$} u(x,y) = min(a \cdot x, b \cdot y) \text{ then we can do this: } a\cdot x^* = b \cdot y^* {/$$}


    You end up buying all of the item with the biggest bang for the buck!

    c. **Perfect Substitutes**:
        

    {$$} \frac{MU_x}{p_x} = \frac{MU_y}{p_y} {/$$}



* NOTE 1: We spend all out money because of free disposal and we make the big assumption that all goods are perfectly divisible 

* NOTE 2: If the relative values were different then the market could find a trade that benefits both.

* NOTE 3: Bang for the Buck:
{$$} 
\frac{MU_x(x^*,y^*)}{p_x} = \frac{MU_y(x^*,y^*)}{p_y}
{/$$}
