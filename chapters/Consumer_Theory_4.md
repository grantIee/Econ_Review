### Deriving the Individual Demand Curve

- Solving for the amount of a given good an agent would demand (*q*) for a variety of different prices (*p*)


**Our Approach:**


- ~~Work out demand for a few prices and connect the dots.~~
- Solve explicitly for a demand function.


First way is sucks because it takes too long. So, just solve for {$$}x^*{/$$} as a function of {$$}p_x{/$$} so that we know the demand for x for any {$$}p_x{/$$}. 


You can still use the two golden rules from Chapter 3, just make sure to leave {$$}p_x{/$$}.


When you plot, because {$$}p_x{/$$} is on the y-axis and *x* is on the x-axis, you would want to solve for {$$}p_x{/$$}


**NOTE** remember that the demand curve is asking for the quantity one demands on the price that varies; hence, **the demand curve should always have the {$$}x^*{/$$} on the left hand side!**.


### Deriving the Market Demand Curve

Must remember that for a large part of the time, the demand equations are provided in terms of {$$} p_x {/$$} which means that you may need to make them into the proper format before adding. 


**WHEN ADDING, THE GRAPH SHOULD MOVE HORIZONTALLY**

1. Add up each of the equations. You should get an {$$} x^*_M=\dots {/$$}

2. Understand that the equation you have may not apply for all values of x.


*Step 2 in more depth:*

The y-axis of the original {$$} p_x {/$$} will suggest that the individual will most likely not demand a given quantity when it goes over that y-intercept. Hence, keep in mind that the aggregate equation does not and will only apply when all participants are involved in the market...


### Quantity Demanded vs. Demand

**Normal Goods**: 


> *Goods for which demands goes **up** when income/wealther goes **up**.*

examples: Most goods...


**Inferior Goods**


> *Goods for which demand goes **down** when income/wealth goes **up**.*

examples: Potatoes, bus rides, canned products


*NOTE: The **demand** for these goods change as income changes...*


**Ordinary Goods**:


> *Goods for which q. demanded goes **down** if the good's price goes **up**.*

**examples: All goods**


**Giffen Goods**:


> *Goods for which q. demanded goes **up** if that good's price goes **up**.*

**examples: Potatoes, kerosene, shochu, usually an inferior product that is the still the cheapest alternative when the price goes up**


**PRICE CHANGE affects Q.DEMANDED = movement allong the graph**


**PRICE OF OTHER GOODS, INCOME affects DEMAND = shift in demand curve**


### Income and Substitution Effects

**Income Effect**


> *The increase in consumption of either or both goods because real wealth is now greater, i.e., we can afford more.*

**Substitution Effect**


> *The increase in consumption of the good whose price was reduced (and decrease in consumption of the other good) because the relative prices of the goods has changed*


### Elasticity

**Price Elasticity of Demand**

price elasticity of demand = {$$}- \frac{\text{percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{percentage change in price}} {/$$}
