### Externalities

**Market Failure**

> A situation in which the allocation of goods and services resulting from a market is not efficient.


*There are times when MSC {$$} \neq {/$$} MC*


This is true, because of something called externalities.


**Externality**

> A cost or benefit imposed or bestowed on an individual or a group that is outside, or external to, the transaction.


We can split the costs into two different categories:

- **Marginal Private Cost (MPC)**: Cost to produce on an individual basis.

- **Marginal External Cost (MEC)**: Cost on society 


From this we can make something like this: *MSC = MPC + MEC*


Be sure to review the graphs and the effects each on possibly has.


Same for the taxes and correcting for externalities...



### Possible Solutions for Externalities


**Government Solutions**:

- Mandates
- Pigouvian Taxes


**Private Solutions:**

- Coase Theorem Bargaining


- **Negative externalities**: tax MPC up to MSC: 

{$$}
MSC = MPC + \text{Marginal tax}
{/$$}


- **Positive Externalities**: subsidize MPB up to MSB:

{$$}
MSB = MPB + \text{Marginal Subsidy}
{/$$}



**Issues with taxes and subsidies for the Government**


- Information and implementation: To correct for the externality, the government must know exactly what the MCS and MSB are which is very difficult

- Regulatory Capture: In order to get the information above, these individuals would often be in the conflict of interests. For example: banker knows all the problems and how to regulate, but he will most likely not want to do such things. 


**Coase Theorem**

> If trade in an externality is possible and there are sufficiently low transaction costs, bargaining will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property.


*If there is a surplus to be gained, bargaining will ensure that it is realized*


### Rival Goods

**Rival Goods**

> A good whose consumption by one consumer prevents simultaneous conseumption by other consumers.


*The opposite of this are known as **non-rival** goods.*


**Excludable Goods**

> A good for which it is possible to prevent access to people who have not paid for it.


*The opposite of this are known as **non-excluable** goods.*


||Excludable|Non-excludable|
|:---:|:----:|:-----:|
|Rival|**Private Goods**|**Common-pool Resource**|
|Non-rival|**Club Goods**|**Public Goods**|


**A public good**

> A good that is non-rival and non-excludable


PROBLEM WITH THIS ONE:


**The Free-Rider Problem**

> The underprovision of a public good resulting from peoples' unwilingness to pay for a product that they can consume without having to pay


Example:


Each sensor costs 5, meaning that MC = 5.


Anne's MPB for sensors is {$$} MPB_A = \frac{10}{x} {/$$}.


Bob's MPB for sensors is {$$} MPB_B = \frac{20}{x} {/$$}.


Hence, if Bob goes to buy sensors -> he will buy 4.


Anne's ideal amount would be {$$} \frac{10}{x} = 5 {/$$} which would be 2. Hence, because there are already 5, she wouldn't feel that need to purchase more. **Anne is a free rider**.


Socially optimal number of snesors equates the marginal social benefit with marginal cost:

{$$}
5 = \frac{20}{x} + \frac{10}{x} \rightarrow x^* = 6
{/$$}

We would ideally want 6, but because Anne is freeriding, there isn't as much of an incentive.


**Tragedy of the commons**


This is the main problem with common-pool resources...

> A situation within a common-pool resource where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource through their collective action.


Governments have role in managing common-pool resources...
