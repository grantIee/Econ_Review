### Monopoly

> An environment in which one firm is the only seller of a particular product/commodity


*A monopoly has the tendency to violate many of the assumptions of PC*


### Marginal Revenue

{$$} MR(q^*) = MC(q^*) {/$$}


*This is different than PC, in a **Monopoly**, the price the monopoly faces p(q) is the **market inverse demand curve**.*


So in PC we had made the assumption that regardless of the quantity, the price would stay the same, in the case for Monopoly, there is a large difference in that as the monopolist **sells more**, the price it can sell at is **reduced**...


**The Math:** 


*Example*

- Suppose **inverse market demand**: {$$} p(q) = 70 - q {/$$}

- The monopolist's revenue: {$$} 70q - q^2 {/$$}

- MR is derivative in terms of q: {$$} 70 - 2q {/$$}


If the monopolist were to sell at the point MR(q) = MC(q), then he would end up with possibly lower outputs and higher prices than perfect competition.


### Welfare Analysis


**What are the welfare consequences?**

- Not a socially optimal outcome

- There is only one firm

- Higher prices and lower quantities



*Keep in mind that the monopolist does not have a supply curve*

- Supply curve is used to show a firm's supply for any price

- Monpolists are not price-takers

- They choose {$$} q^M {/$$} based upon the demand curve and MC


### Government Policies and Monopolies

**Natural Monopoly**

> A natural monopoly is a firm in which the most efficient scale is very large.

- Usually because fixed costs are large

- Large barrier to entry; hence, not many firms are present
