# Industrial Organization 2

**Oligopoly**

> A form of industry (market) structure characterized by a few dominant firms.


*They come in three forms:*


- Cartels: act together like a monopolist

- Cournot Competition: compete on quantity

- Bertrand Competition: compete on price


### Cartels

> In a cartel, firms conspire to behave like a monopolist


- Like a duopoly and will have the same graph as a monopoly

- The profits end up being split evenly between the two companies. Hence, will not be producing as much as a monopoly.


{$$} \dots {/$$}


**The issues with Cartels**

- In a cartel, each firm has incentives to cheat (overproduce):


**NOT CHEATING**


**If {$$} q_B {/$$} = 20**


*It would be appropriate for A to also make 20*


{$$} q = q_A + q_B {/$$}


- Revenue = {$$} q \cdot p(q) = 100q - q^2 {/$$} and {$$} MR(q) = 100 - 2q {/$$}

- Setting MR(q) = MC(q) yields {$$} q^{CARTEL} = 40 {/$$}

- Profits: {$$} 60 \cdot 20 - 20 \cdot 20 = 800 {/$$}


**CHEATING**


*In the case that A decides to cheat, then he would produce something greater...*


- Marginal Revenue: {$$} MR(q_A) = 80 - 2q_A {/$$} 
- 80 - {$$} 2q_A {/$$} = 20, we get that A produces 30...
- A profits = 900
- B profits = 600


*In a cartel, firms limit their production because they take into account not just the affect of producing an extra unit on the price that they sell their other units, but also the affect on the price at which the other firms sell their output.*


### Cournot Competition

*In this case, the firms react to each other. In cournot, the firms react and will produce a given amount in consideration of what the other company may be doing.*

-Total Quantity: {$$} q = q_A + q_B = \frac{160}{3} {/$$}

-Market Price is {$$} p(q) = 100 - \frac{160}{3} = \frac{140}{3} {/$$}

-Firm i's profits are {$$} q_i \cdot p(q) - 20q_i = \frac{80}{3}(\frac{140}{3} - 20) = \frac{6400}{9} {/$$}


*Remember an oligopoly is not only 2 firms. They may just as well have 4,5, or any number that is at least 2.*


### Bertrand Competition

*Firms will choose their prices instead of the price changing as a result of their output...*

**Assumptions:**

- Consumers buy the cheapest alternative

- If both alternatives have equal prices, half of the consumers purchase each good

- Each of the competing firms can supply the whole market at any price


This is the market system that is slightly weird, because each firm will have its given shutdown price. Hence, it will be a piece-wise equation where the lower bound will cease to sell when the opponent's price is lower than their shutdown price. 


You end up with the weird virus looking graph but there will be an intersection point where the firms may end up selling at which is the point when one of the firms will try to sell it at the price just 1 cent above the shutdown point of it's competitor.


### Conclusion

Who is right?


- Capacity and output can be easily changed -> Bertrand 

- Else, Cournot is typically better...
