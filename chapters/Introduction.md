# Introduction

### What is economics?

> *Economics is the study of how individuals and societies **choose** to use **scarce** resources.*


**Six Principles:**


1. The optimal decision equates the relevant costs and benefits at the margin.

2. Some costs (e.g., opportunity costs) matter, others (e.g., sunk costs) don't.

3. A market is in equilibrium when no opportunities for individual advantage remain.

4. Market equilibrium is sometimes optimal, and sometimes not.

5. Everyone does best when each person does whatever he or she does best in relative terms.

6. Incentives matter, in the design of both private and public policy.

### Postive vs. Normative

**Positive**:


> *"objective and fact-based, can be tested to be proven or disproven"*


- government-provided healthcare increases public expenditures


- Higher taxes on cigarettes causes people to smoke less due to the increased prices


- Demand falls when price rises


- Income inequality exists in all countries


These statements do not have to be true as long as they can be tested and based on evidence-based reasoning.


**Normative**:


> *"subjective and value-based, opinion-based and cannot be proved or disproved"*


- We should cut taxes in half to increase disposable income levels


- Women should be provided higher school loans than men


- Laborers should recieve greater parts of capitalist profits


- Working citizens should not pay for hospital care


NOTE: Although most normative statements use 'should' and 'ought' a lot as they are making an opinion about the way things have to be. These words can also be used to make positive statments and can trick you!




> *"We tend to agree on the normative, argue on the postive..."*

### Friedman, Theory and Assumptions


**What is theory?**:


- A language designed to promote systematic and organized methods of reasoning.

- A body of substantive hypotheses designed to abstract essential features of a complex reality.


**Components of theory:**


- Assumptions
    - a thing that is accepted as true without proof
- Model
    - a simplified description of a system or process
- Implication 
    - a conclusion that can be drawn


**Example:**


- **Law of Falling Bodies:**
    - Assumption: We are in a vacuum.
    - Model: An object falling in a vacuum.
    - Implications: Accerlation of a body dropped is *g* and distance is s = {$$} 
    \frac{1}{2}gt^2
    {/$$}

- **Density of Leaves on a Tree:**
    - Assumption: Leaves make decision and are very smart.
    - Model: A bunch of little decision-making leaves picking locations on a tree
    - Implication: Leaves are positioned as if each sought to maximize its amount of sunlight.


*Of these models which one is right? How do we judge these models?*


Generally, you want to question not the realism of the model. You just want to make sure that the model works in the context of the setting and that the model makes a good prediction.
