# Markets and Efficiency 1

### Markets

What is a market?


Consists of Market Demand (consumer theory) and Market Supply (producer theory).


Market Equilibrium {$$} (Q^*,P^*) {/$$} is where {$$} D(P^*) = S(P^*) {/$$}: We call this point **Market-Clearing**


Supply and Demand curves are usually not known by the actors; hence, they must use *tatonnement* (groping) for the price. 

### Walrasian Tatonnement

1. Call out a starting price ({$$} P_i {/$$})

2. Take sellers that are willing to sell at that price and call that group S({$$} P_i {/$$}) and the people that want to buy at that price D({$$} P_i {/$$})

3. Then you can choose tomorrow's price based on step 2. 


Where:

- If S = D, we have market price
- If S > D, we have to lower the price
- If S < D, we have to higher the price


### A Positive Demand Shock

- A positive shock to demand leads to individuals suddnely have a high demand of something...

**Short Run**
1. Demand shifts out
2. Demand shifting out increases the market price
3. Firms make profits
4. Because we operate at p = mc, each individual firm will be producing more.


**Long Run**
5. Other firms will enter the market because they are attracted to the industry.
6. As more firms enter the market, supply will increase.
7. Supply wiil shift out
8. Price may return to the original or go below original but will certainly go down.
9. Depending on how much the price goes down, the quantity each individual firm sells will change.
10. Firms are no longer making a profit and will most likely be breaking even.


NOTE: Possibility that the sudden influx of firms may also cause for the input costs to increase which would in turn lead to the ATC being driven up.


### A Negative Demand Shock

- A negative shock to demand leads to individuals suddenly decreasing their demand for a given product...

**Short Run**
1. Demand will shift inwards as the demand decreases
2. Because of the shift inward, it is likely that the market price shifts downwards. 
3. At this point, some firms depending on their AVC may decide to shutdown.
4. Individuals firms are now producing less.  

**Long Run**
5. Firms will begin to exit as they are no longer at the break even point.
6. As firms begin to leave, supply shifts in.
7. This leads to an increase in the market price
8. Price will return to equillibrium price leading to teh same price. There will be less firms in the market.


NOTE: Possibility that the ATC goes down as the resouce to create the product now costs less because there are less firms. Which could have easily shifted the ATC to the beginning price which would in turn have changed the price to be P2 < P1.


### Positive Supply Shock

- A positive supply shock may be the result when an individual firm or industry suddenly discovers new technology or something like that would increase the supply for something...


**Short Run**
1. Supply Curve will shift out
2. This leads to lower market price and increased supply of the product
3. DEMAND will **not** respond
4. Leads to a change in quantity demanded but no change in demand

**Long Run**
5. There will be an increase in the quantity demanded meaning that more of the product will be consumed, but that is all
6. ON a firm level, at an increase in supply, there is a possible decrease in the cost. Hence the firms are just able to produce at lower costs


Remember what usually causes a shift in supply and connect the dots that a supply shift means no change in profit or loss.


The only thing that may be true is that on the long run, each individuala firm may have the tendency to either produce more individually (supply shifts out) or produce less (supply shifts in)


### Surplus and Efficiency

**Willingness to Accept (WTA)**

> The minimum amount a producer will accept to sell a good.


**Surplus for a Producer**

> The difference between what a producer is paid and what she is willing to accept.


**Total Surplus**

> The consumer surplus + The producer surplus


Conclusions:


Markets are efficient in that the market price maximizes TS


There are other issues with government price-setting 


i.e. price ceilings, price floor...
