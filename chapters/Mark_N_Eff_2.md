# Markets and Efficiency 2

### Exchange Economies:

**Pure Exchange Economy**:


- Instead of production, agents just enter the market with endowments of each good



**Feasibility**


Is it possible to allocate the goods equally 



### Utilitarianism

Maximize utility


- **Benthamite**:  Want to maximize; hence, if there is an individual who benefits the most from a given amount. Ex: If there is a poor person that doesn't like caviar, but a rich person who really likes it. Then from a benthamite perspective it makes sense to give the caviar to the person who was richer.

- **Rawlsian**: The chain is only as strong as the weakest link. The overall function is best when you provide the wealth to the poorest person. 


**Utility Monsters!**: 


Keep in mind that there is a loophole to each of the scenarios above. One person can just have a ridiculous utility function and take all the cookies. Or a person with a ridiculously low utility function can game the system to obtain all the goods as well...



### Pareto Efficiency


**Pareto Improvement**

> A change from one feasible allocation to another feasible one that makes at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off.


**Pareto Efficiency (or Pareto optimality)**

> A state of allocation in which it is impossible to make anyone better off without making at least one individual worse off. OR: An allocation for which no Pareto improvement exists.



### Productive Efficiency


**Efficient Production**

- Suppose we can produce one unit of output with one unit of capital and one unit of labor

- OR we can produce one unit of output with two of each

- First option is more efficient


**Absolute Advantage**


The person who can make the most items. If given in terms of time, it is based on the most made in a given time.


**Comparative Advantage**


The person that can make the most of something at the lowest cost. Ex: if bob can make 4 cats or 3 dogs, we know that it costs him 3 dogs to make 4 cats or 3/4 of a cat to make 1 dog.


### Allocative Efficiency 

Optimal Production:


We want when MSB > MSC


When MSB is equal to MSC, then you are allocatively efficient
