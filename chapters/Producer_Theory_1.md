# Producer Theory 1

These chapters shouldn't be all that different to the previous chapters regarding Consumer Theory...


**The Two Main Things We Care About**

1. Cost Minimization
2. Profit Maximization


### Technologies

In Consumer theory, we considered the consumer's preference as exogenous.


In Producer theory, we consider the technologies to be exogenous.


**Technology**


> *An ability to convert a certain vector of inputs into a certain vector of outputs*


### Production Functions


F(K,L) = min(K,L)


F(K,L) = {$$} \frac{1}{2} \cdot K + \frac{1}{2} \cdot L {/$$}


F(K,L) = {$$} \sqrt{K} \cdot \sqrt{L} {/$$}


Can have many types but these should look somewhat familiar. 


### Marginal Products

**Marginal Product of Capital ({$$} MP_K {/$$})**

> Rate at which output increases as we increase capital:

{$$}
MP_K(K,L) = F(K + 1, L) - F(K,L)
{/$$}


**Marginal Product of Labor ({$$} MP_L {/$$}**

> Rate at which output increases as we increase labor:

{$$}
MP_L(K,L) = F(K,L + 1) - F(K,L)
{/$$}


### Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution

**Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS)**

> The rate at which a firm can substitute capital for labor while holding output constant:

{$$}
MRTS_{KL}(K,L) = \frac{MP_K(K,L)}{MP_L(K,L)} = - \text{Slope of Isoquant}
{/$$}


### Returns of Scale


Let {$$} \alpha > 1 {/$$} :


- A production function has **increasing returns to scale** if:
{$$}
F(\alpha \cdot K, \alpha \cdot L) > \alpha F(K,L)

- A production function has **constant returns to scale** if: 
{$$}
F(\alpha \cdot K, \alpha \cdot L) = \alpha F(K,L)
{/$$}

- A production function has **decreasing returns to scale** if:
{$$}
F(\alpha \cdot K, \alpha \cdot L) < \alpha F(K,L)
{/$$}

### Cost of Business

**Cost of Capital and Labor**

{$$} 
C(K,L) = p_K \cdot K + p_L \cdot L
{/$$}


THIS IS NOT A COST CURVE


### Isocost

> A line in (K,L)-space that represents all combinations of K and L such that C(K,L) = z for some z


The budget line was a line in the (x,y)-space representing all bundles for which C(x,y) = w, where w was wealth/income.


Remember, the cost is not a budget and is something that is only to be reduced.
    

The more outward an isocost is, the higher the cost. Want to be in the lower left corner.


### Minimizing the Cost

Usually given the production function, price of capital, and price of labor.


**The Golden Equations**


1. Equation 1: 
F(K,L) = q

2. Equation 2:
    - CD: {$$} MRTS_{KL}(K^*,L^*) = \frac{P_K}{P_L} {/$$}
    - PC: {$$} a \cdot K^* = b \cdot L^* {/$$}
    - PS: Bang for the Buck
        - {$$} \frac{MP_K}{P_K} > \frac{MP_L}{P_L} {/$$}: All L
        - {$$} \frac{MP_K}{P_K} < \frac{MP_L}{P_L} {/$$}: All K
        - {$$} \frac{MP_K}{P_K} = \frac{MP_L}{P_L} {/$$}: Nothing


To get the cost curve, you make the Equation 2 in terms of q and then input it into Equation 1 and solve for q.
