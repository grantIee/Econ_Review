# Producer Theory 2

### Types of Cost

PT 1 focused mainly on the **variable costs** which are incurred in the **short run**


**Total Fixed Cost (TFC)**

> Any cost that does not depend on the firm's level of output.


- Costs that are still incurred when producing nothing.

- No fixed costs in the long run


**Average Fixed Costs (AFC) = {$$} \frac{\text{Total fixed cost}}{\text{Quantity Produced}} {/$$}**

The averaged fixed cost should be decreasing as the numerator remains constant while the denominator continues to grow.


**Total Variable Cost (TVC)**

> A cost that depends on the level of production chosen.


**Average Variable Cost (AVC) = {$$} \frac{\text{Total Variable Cost}}{\text{Quantity Produced}} {/$$}**



**Total Cost (TC)**

> Total fixed cost plus total variable cost. (TC = TFC + TVC)


### Marginal Cost

**Marginal Cost**

> The rate at which total cost increases as we increase output:

{$$}
MC(q) = TC(q+1) - TC(q) = TVC(q+1) - TVC(q)
{/$$}


### Assumption 1: Perfect Competition

Key Assumption: PERFECT COMPETITION

- Firms are "price-takers"
    - A price-taking firm sells its full output at the market price
    - Choice of quantity doesn't affect the price

### Assumption 2: Increasing Marginal Cost

- Returns of scale are **decreasing**
- Marginal products are **decreasing**
- Marginal cost is **increasing**

*\* getting bigger = getting less efficient*



### Perfect Competition

**What is perfect competition?**

> An industry structure in which there are many firms, each small relative to the industry, producing identical products and in which no firm is large enough to have any control over prices. Firms may enter and exit the industry freely.


Has a perfectly elastic (horizontal) demand curve and can sell as my units as they want without affecting the price.


### Maximizing Profits

Firms want to maximize profits. 


We find that {$$} MR(q^*) = MC(q^*) {/$$}


Revenues = {$$} p(q) \cdot q {/$$}


Because we know that q will not affect the pricebecause in PC individual firms do not have that ability...


{$$} p = MC(q^*) {/$$}


### Minimizing Losses

Profits and Losses:

- You can only make profits and losses in the short run

- In the long run it is expected that you are making a total economic profit of 0


When **{$$} p < AVC(q^*) {/$$}**:


The firm **SHUTS DOWN**

*In other words, a firm will shut down when each product that they sell is not even recouping the price it takes to make their product*


When **{$$} p < ATC(q^*) {/$$}**:

The firm is **BREAKING EVEN**

*In other words, a firm who's total costs are equal to the price, may have the opportunity to recoup costs of capital and other things. The price is still high enough to continue producing because they might not be making profit, but they are not losing money. And can make payments on certain things...*
