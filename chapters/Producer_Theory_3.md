# Producer Theory 3

### Market Supply

- Again, market supply when aggregated should move horizontally.

- Hence you are tying to solve for the quantity a producer is willing to produce at a given price. 

1. Convert inverse supplies to supplies. At the end you want a {$$} q_M {/$$}

2. Aggregate the supplies

3. Change the equation and solve for P or the inverse market supply for the graph

4. Consider the shutdown points where if p < some value, only a given firm will be willing to produce.


Like before:

- A change in *p* yields a change in quantity supplied. Which is a **movement along supply curve**

- A change in anything other than *p* yields a new supply curve. (Input prices change, new firms enter, technologies change, etc.)

### Long-Run

**In the short-run:**

- Firms face a fixed set of technologies
- Firms choose variable capital and labor, K and L
- Firms may make profits or losses


**In the long-run:**

- Firms may choose their technologies (costs are accounted for)
- Firms make no profits/losses


Invidiual Firms:

- It chooses what size factory to operate
- It thereby chooses its scale
- Difference scales might have different minimal average costs


**Minimum efficient scale (MES)**

> The smallest size at which long-run average cost curve is at its minimum


**Long-run Industry Supply (LRIS)**

> A curve that traces out price and total output over time as an industry expands


If the LRIS is \_\_\_\_ as the industry expands, we call it a \_\_\_\_.

- decreasing, **decreasing-cost industry**
- constant, **constant-cost industry**
- increasing, **increasing-cost industry**
