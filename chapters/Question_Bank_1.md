# Question Bank 1

#### 1. Voting Questions (1,2)

When given a table of numbers, the first choice corresponds to the voter's first choice. Hence, when given something like this:


|#|6|6|6|4|2|3|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|First Choice:|A|C|B|B|C|A|
|Second Choice:|B|A|C|A|B|C|
|Third Choice:|C|B|A|C|A|B|


One can calculate the following:

|#|A|B|C|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|First Choice:|9|10|8|
|Second Choice:|10|8|9|
|Third Choice:|8|9|10|

Using this you can solve these voting questions...

#### 3. Preference Problems:[^f2]

*Remember that for a given preference problem, 2 things must always be checked. **Completeness and Transitivity**.*


**Examples:**

1. {$$} {z \sim y, x \preceq y, z \succeq y, x \sim y} {/$$}

2. {$$} {x \sim z, x \succ y, y \sim z} {/$$}

3. {$$} {x \succeq z, z \succeq y, x \prec y, z \prec x} {/$$}

4. {$$} {y \prec z, z \succ x, z \succeq y} {/$$}

5. Suppose there are three alternatives (a,b,c) and Dave the deer's entire preferences are:
{$$}
a \succ b, b \succ c
{/$$}
    
    a. Is he rational?

    b. Add an additional comparison that would make Dave rational.

    c. What needs to be added to make Dave violate transitivity?

#### 6. Indifference Curves

You are given:

> *Something regarding your preferences.*

> **Sometimes a utility function is just given**



You are asked to:

> *What assumption is violated? (variant)*

> *Given a wage, what are the prices of x and y*

> *Given a point on the graph, what is the upper and lower bound for the utility?*

> *What bundle of x and y appears to be optimal based on the budget line?*

> *Based on the utility function given, what is the utility plot*

> *Sometimes given weird utility functions and have to conceptualize*
